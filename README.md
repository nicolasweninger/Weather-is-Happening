# Weather is Happening
This is a Formlabs 2018 Hackathon Project, built by myself, Ben Parnas (https://www.linkedin.com/in/beparnas/) and Thomas Orr (https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-orr-a47b5176/). The project is inspired by the work of the bizzae Boston weather service weatherishappening.com.

The weather station is battery powered, waterproof and radio-enabled, allowing it to remotely transmit windspeed data to the weather base station. The base station warns of high windspeeds with a loud red siren alarm and obnoxious light. This repo contains the hand-drawn schematic and the slapped together code that we used for the final product.
